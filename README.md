# Dust Collector

This is the firmware for the Arduino-based system I use in my workshop. It's
inspired by [Bob Clagett's system][iltms], with a few changes. Notably, I
skipped the current sensors and opted to just have a button at each tool
station that will open the appropriate blast gates and toggle the dust
collector.
